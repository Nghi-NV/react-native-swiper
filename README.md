## Why create this?

I've found existing swiping components to be buggy and not working fully on both platforms.

## Features

* Autoplay
* Horizontal swiping
* Works when orientation changes
* Cross-platform
* Works with any view size
* Custom styling
* Pressable circle buttons
* API

## Getting started

Install the npm package.

```
npm i react-native-swipe-a-lot --save
```

Import the SwipeALot component wherever you'd like to use it.

```
import SwipeALot from 'react-native-swipe-a-lot'
```

In your render method, simply use it as a wrapper around Views.

```
class Root extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <SwipeALot>
        <View>
          <Text>This is slide 1</Text>
        </View>
        <View>
          <Text>This is slide 2</Text>
        </View>  
      </SwipeALot>
    )
  }
}
```

## Running the demo

First run `npm install`

Then simply run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`

## Configuration

You can pass these props to the component:

`autoplay` makes the component automatically swipe to other pages. It is disabled by default. Pass an object as a prop here to configure it:

```
{
  enabled: false,
  disableOnSwipe: false,
  delayBetweenAutoSwipes: 5000
}
```

`onSetActivePage` is a function that returns current index of the page when user swipes or clicks on a circle
```
<SwipeALot
  onSetActivePage={(index) => { console.log('Current Page is: ', index); }}
>
</SwipeALot>
```

`wrapperStyle` defines how the container that contains the swiping views looks. By default no styling is applied.

`circleDefaultStyle` defines how the inactive circles on your swiper component look. You can pass an object here with style properties that you wish to override.


Default style:
```
{
  width: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(6),
  height: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(6),
  margin: 10,
  backgroundColor: 'rgb(158, 158, 158)',
  borderRadius: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(3)
}
```

`circleActiveStyle` defines how the active circle on your swiper component looks. You can pass an object here with style properties that you wish to override.

Default style:
```
{
  backgroundColor: 'rgb(245, 245, 245)',
}
```

## API

### How to use
